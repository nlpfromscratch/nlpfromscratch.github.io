    "\n",
    "This notebook is best run in [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/), where the majority of dependencies are already installed.

    "\n",
    "Since we will be using GPU in this notebook for compute-intensive tasks, please ensure that if running on Colab the runtime type is set to GPU. In the menu in Colab, select *Runtime -> Change runtime type*, then select T4 GPU (if using Colab Free) or another GPU instance type if using Colab Pro.\n",

    "Now that we have covered some of the fundamentals of working with pre-trained large language models for generative text, we will progress to the more advanced task of adapting pre-trained models to specific tasks or datasets to change their behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "Adapting a pre-trained LLM for a new problem or specific dataset by updating its parameters through further training is referred to as [fine-tuning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fine-tuning_(deep_learning)). Though the nomenclature has evolved and the terms are now sometimes used interchangeably, this technique is a type of [transfer learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transfer_learning). Other methods for transfer learning do exist, and so the term \"fine-tuning\" should be more specifically use to refer to cases in which model weights are updated (or new model weights are added and optimized) against a new dataset or objective.\n",
    "\n",
    "In practice, the term *fine-tuning* is more commonly now used with respect to LLMs, while that of *transfer learning* to refer to the larger group of approaches, usually inside the domain of machine learning and deep learning outside of language models.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the most common applications for fine-tuning is to take a well-performing pre-trained language model (foundation model) as a base and adapt this to a new classification task. This is commonly done with the [BERT model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BERT_(language_model) as a base, which has already learned powerful and meaningful representations of language, and adapt it to other NLP tasks, for example, by attaching a classification \"head\", or even by having another simple classifier model take the outputs of the BERT model as inputs for a classification task.\n",

    "#### Model Quantization\n",
    "\n",
    " Quantization is a model size reduction technique that loads the model weights in a lower precision than they were originally trained in, resulting in a reduction in the storage and compute costs for the model.\n",
    "\n",
    " This can mean taking a model which originally had its weights stored in a high-precision format, such as 32 or 16-bit floating point, and converting them into a lower precision such as 8-bit (or even 4-bit!) integer values.\n",
    "\n",
    " Surprisingly, even with this loss of precision, many sophisticated LLMs are still found to perform quite well after quantization.\n",
    "\n",
    " Model quantization approaches do not just simply round or truncate the weight values, they are converted using a formula like the below in the [affine quantization scheme](https://pytorch.org/blog/quantization-in-practice/#affine-and-symmetric-quantization-schemes):\n",
    "\n",
    " $x_q = round(x/S + Z)$\n",
    "\n",
    " where:\n",
    " - $x_q$ is the quantized value\n",
    " - $x$ is the original value\n",
    " - $S$ is the *scale factor*\n",
    " - $Z$ is the zero point\n",
    "\n",
    "Optimal values can all be determined as part of the quantization process in calibration.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are also well-known more sophisticated approaches for quantization such as [GPT-Q](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.17323) and [Activation-aware Weight Quantization (AWQ)](https://github.com/mit-han-lab/llm-awq) which have been applied to create qunatized versions of popular models which are highly optimized inference. In the Hugging Face space, Tom Jobbins (*a.k.a* [The Bloke](https://huggingface.co/TheBloke)) is a well-known individual for producing many quantized versions and variations of popular models.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's try loading a large version of GPT-2 using qunatization, and then do some inference. Here we will use [GPT2-XL](https://huggingface.co/gpt2-xl), the 1.5B parameter version of GPT-2, which weighs in at ~6.5GB! All we need to do is pass the `load_in_4bit=True` parameter when loading the model to apply quantization:"

    "## Conclusion 🏁\n",
    "\n",
    "We have covered a lot of ground in both working with generative large language models for inference, as well as methods for efficiently fine-tuning them with limited computational resources. However, we have really just scratched the surface of LLMs for text, and there is much more that makes up the incredibly sophisticated models which represent the state of the art.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Training \"chat\" models**: By changing the [format of the input](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/main/en/chat_templating) and prediction task, and applying more sophisticated approaches such as [instruction tuning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.10792).\n",
    "- **Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF)**: Now a standard part of LLM development but is non-trivial for the individual. However, this is possible to do with a base model and the right datasets using the [trl library](https://huggingface.co/docs/trl/index).\n",
    "- **Retrieval Augmented Generation**: Or [RAG](https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper/2020/hash/6b493230205f780e1bc26945df7481e5-Abstract.html), for combining the generative capabilities of LLMs with search and retrieval from a datastore, to reduce \"hallucinations\" and be able to have a language model work against a knowledge base.\n",
    "\n",
    "LLMs represent the state of the art in generative text models and have rapidly transformed this space (and many other domains) in a very short order. Knowing how how they function, how to use them, and being aware of their shortcomings allows them to be judiciously applied to the right use cases to unlock business value and build product of value to the end-user."
