    "\n",
    "Since we will be using GPU in this notebook for compute-intensive tasks, please ensure that if running on Colab the runtime type is set to GPU. In the menu in Colab, select *Runtime -> Change runtime type*, then select T4 GPU (if using Colab Free) or another GPU instance type if using Colab Pro.\n",

    "## Large Language Models (LLMs) and the Transformer Architecture\n",
    "\n",
    "What is a large language language model (LLM)? While there is no universally accepted definition for an LLM, large language models are a type of deep learning model that is understood be both very large in size (number of parameters) and also trained on very large datasets. Lately, the datasets used to train LLMs have grown increasingly in size and it is not unusual for these to represent double digit percentages of the web.\n",
    "\n",
    "LLMs are a type of *deep learning* model, also known as a neural network, a type of machine learning model that seeks to imitate the structure of the human brain. Traditional deep learning models take inputs - structured data found in rows and columns like in a database, or unstructured data like images, video, audio, or, in the case of natural language processing (NLP) models, free-form text - and use these to make predictions about a target variables associated with each observation (row) in the input data. For example, in the case of a deep learning models for computer vision, the input could be a dataset of images and the output to predict an associated data label (which Japanese character is this?).\n",
    "\n",
    "<center><img src=\"../assets/ann_diagram.png\"/></center>\n",
    "\n",
    "Deep learning models are composed of *layers*, each of which is composed of *nodes*, and each of the nodes has inputs which come from previous layers and associated *weights* which are multiplied by each of the inputs. Collectively, these weights are referred to as the model *parameters* we mentioned earlier, and what is learned in the \"learning\" of deep learning is the optimal values for these numeric parameters to best predict the outcome.\n",
    "\n",
    "Large language models are a category of deep learning models with the following properties:\n",
    "- They primarily work with language data (*i.e.* text), either as input, or output, or both - either solely or in conjuction with other data types (images, audio, video, etc.), in which case the LLMs are referred to as *multimodal*.\n",
    "- As mentioned above, LLMs are understood to be both very large in size in both model size (hundreds of millions, billions, hundreds of billions, or even *trillions* of parameters) as well as trained on very large datasets, comprising hundreds of millions or billions of tokens.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is from the latter of these two properties that the remarkable capabilities of recent LLMs has arisen. There is one another important fundamental development which lead to the rise of LLMs as we know them today and that is the transformer architecture."

    "### The Transformer Architecture\n",
    "\n",
    "We refer to the structure of a deep learning network as its *architecture* - the example showed in the previous section is that of the simplest type of deep learning model architecture referred to as a *feed-forward* or *fully connected* neural network, since the outputs of each node in the hidden layers serve as input for each node in the following layer.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many different types of more complex and specialized architectures for specific tasks and use cases in deep learning. This have arisen from years of research in academia and application in industry. For example, convolution neural networks (CNNs) are the standard for working with computer vision tasks and have different types of layers specifically suited for this.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Transformer architecture is an enitrely new type of neural network architecture of which the vast majority (but not all) large language models are. The Transformer was introduced fairly recently in the paper [Attention is All You Need](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762) (Vaswani et al, 2018) by researchers from Google Brain. As an interesting side note, contributors to the paper have moved on to notable AI startups - Aiden Gomez went on to be one of the founders of the OpenAI competitior [Cohere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohere) and Noam Shazeer to co-found [Character.ai](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Character.ai). While the transformer architecture was originally devised to be applied to a text-to-text translation task (English and German) and work with what now comparatively is a very small dataset, it has now been found to be broadly applicable and highly performant to a very wide variety of natural language processing tasks and represents the state-of-the-art for most of these, ranging from text generation which will cover in this workshop, to other applications such as image generation, such as with OpenAI's [DALL-E](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DALL-E) models.\n",

    "<caption> The Transformer Architecture, as originally presented in the Attention is All You Need paper </caption></center>\n",
    "\n",
    "While the mathematical and technical details of the transformer are very complex, we will not dive too deeply into these here - there are many resources out there available which cover this - for example, [Transformers from Scratch](https://peterbloem.nl/blog/transformers) and the reimplementation of the GPT model, [MinGPT](https://github.com/karpathy/minGPT) by Andrej Karpathy, previously at Tesla and now back at OpenAI.\n",

    "### Encoder and Decoder Models\n",
    "\n",
    "The transformer model is made up of two large blocks: the *encoder* block on the left, and the *decoder* block on the right. While the original transformer architecture was comprised of both of these, there are now specific models which are composed of stacked blocks of each type. For example, models in the research can be *encoder-only* or *decoder-only* models, or a fully transformer with both encoder and decoder. It should be noted that, in practice, these would all still be referred to as transformer models even though the former two are not \"full\" transformers based upon the strict definition of the architecture.\n",
    "\n",
    "Encoder and decoder models have different tasks to which they are well-suited. Generally speaking, encoder models take text as input and produce a higher dimensional representation of the dataset (corpus) of text - an *embedding* - on which they are trained. You will also sometime hear encoder models referred to *autoencoding* models, as they perform a similar task to the traditional [autoencoder model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autoencoder) in deep learning.\n",

    "</center>\n",
    "\n",
    "Decoder models, on the other hand, take inputs and produces output probabilities. Most commonly, these are known for doing text generation, where the model take a sequence of text as input and makes predictions about the most likely occuring words which come next, as made famous by the [Generative Pretrained Transformer (GPT)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_pre-trained_transformer) model by OpenAI which we will work with shortly. You will also hear decoder-only models referred to as *autoregressive* models, as they take their own outputs as inputs (in order to make predictions about a sequence of text, word-by-word) and uses these to predict probabilities for the next word (a regression task). As we will see shortly, this type of task in natural language processing is also referred to as *causal language modeling*."

    "\n",
    "In this section, we will start generating text with our first large language model, [GPT-2](https://huggingface.co/gpt2) and explore some of the parameters which affect the outputs from a generative text model.\n",
    "\n",
    "The GPT-2 (Generative Pre-trained Transformer 2) model was the last of the series of GPT models from OpenAI which was \"open\". Following its release in 2019, GPT-3 and subsequent models did not have their weights made available publicly (and in the case for more recent models such as GPT-4, nor the details of their training data and training process).\n",
    "\n",
    "We can easily work with GPT-2 in [Hugging Face](https://www.huggingface.co). The easiest way to get results as quickly as possible is to use a [pipeline](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/main_classes/pipelines) to generate text *i.e.* to perform inference.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, we import the Pipeline class from the `transformers` library, then creator an instance of it, specifying the model type we wish to use. In this case, we want to use GPT-2, which is hosted Hugging Face themselves, not as part of a user repo, so the URL for it is just `gpt2`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Pipelines can also be for a large variety of different tasks, we must specify that the pipeline is for text generation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we check whether GPU is available (it should be on Colab) and if so, set the model to use GPU. This requires importing [pytorch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PyTorch) (`torch`), which is the first line of code."

Creating new outputs from a given prompt is not as simple as entering the input and getting a predicted output. Generative text models have parameters which control the amount of variability in their outputs; this is a desirable quality to make the outputs seem both more realistic (as if from a human) and  variety being injected into the model outputs also increases the likelihood of reaching a novel result that is pleasing to the user and deemed to be \"good\".\n",

    "- $P(y_i)$ is the probability of selecting the $i$th token.\n",
    "- $z_i$ is the logit, the raw score or output, from the model for token $i$\n",
    "- and $N$ is the total size of the vocabulary\n",
    "\n",
    "we introduce a new variable $\\tau$ for temperature and update the probability formula as below:\n",
    "\n",
    "$P(y_i) = \\frac{e^{z_i / \\tau}}{\\sum_{j=1}^{N}e^{z_j / \\tau}}$\n",
    "\n",
    "Given the above, if $\\tau = 1$, the formula for the probabilities, and thus the behavior of the model, is unchanged. It can be shown that as $\\tau \\to \\infty$, that $P(y_i) \\to 1$ for all $i$, and so the likelihood of any token predicted becomes equal. This results in a completely uniform distribution of probabilities acrosss all possible tokens.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, as $\\tau \\to 0$, the probability for any given token can be represented by:\n",

    "The models were trained on JSON which contain conversations, with three different roles:\n",
    "- The **user** role: This is us, or the person talking to the chat bot.\n",
    "- The **assistant** role: These are the responses from the model.\n",
    "- The **system** role: This is a role that dictates the overall behavior of the model and style of its responses.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, in a way, an chat-style model is not actually responding, but applying the \"autcomplete on steroids\" of regular generative text models, just in this case autcompleting a conversation, and we are only show the responses from the *assistant* role, and we provide the responses for the *user* role."
