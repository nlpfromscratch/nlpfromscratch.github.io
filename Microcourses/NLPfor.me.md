## Details 
### Course Overview:
‚åõ Duration: 6 Weeks, October-November 2024  
üìÖ Dates: Mondays 7-10 PM EST  
üïí Sessions: 6 Sessions, 3 Hours Each  
üíª Format: Live Online, Interactive Sessions via Google Meet  
üí∞ Pricing: [Pay What You Can (PWYC)](https://www.nlpfromscratch.com/pwyc)

### Why this course?
- **Flexible Pricing**: Our PWYC model ensures that financial constraints don‚Äôt hold you back from learning.
- **100% Live Online Instruction**: The course is delivered 100% live and online via Google Meet. Join the class, get your questions answered live.
- **Hands-On Learning**: The best way to learn is by doing! Go hands-on with code in python and apply NLP with libraries like sklearn and deep learning with Tensorflow.
- **Learn with Community**: Join a group of dedicated learners, and upskill together with the support of others, and build your network in data and NLP!

### What is the curriculum?
NLP for me was a live, online delivery based on the NLP4Free microcourse, along with additional supplemental content. The contents are available here or on the official github page at [nlpfor.me](nlpfor.me).

You can also just pull down the whole curriculum at once with:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/nlpfromscratch/nlpfor.me.git`
```

### What You‚Äôll Learn:
1. **Introduction to NLP**: Get started with the basics of Natural Language Processing. Understand its significance, applications, and the foundational concepts that drive this field. Get an overview of the course and what‚Äôs ahead and get your burning questions on NLP answered. Get your natural language processing development environment set up with python and other essential tools.
2. **Data Acquisition & Preprocessing**: Learn how to gather and prepare data for NLP tasks. Explore techniques for scraping, normalizing, and transforming text data to make it ready for analysis. Work with REST APIs to acquire text data and use python to scrape text data from web pages. Learn about preprocessing text data with vectorization and using the scikit-learn library.
3. **Machine Learning and Sentiment Analysis**: Apply machine learning to perform tasks using language data. Fit a simple learn model for binary sentiment classification. Perform model introspection to understand model coefficients.
4. **Unsupervised Methods for NLP**: Learn how to use unsupervised learning for applications such as topic modeling for finding common topics over large bodies of documents, and fundamental embedding models such as GLoVe and fasttext.
5. **Deep Learning for Natural Language**: Learn the fundamentals of neural network and how deep learning works with feed forward networks, the foundation to state of the art large language models (LLMs) based on the transformer architecture. Go hands-on in code with Tensorflow and fit a neural network to an NLP task.
6. **Case Study**: Apply what you've learned and go hands-on as we work through a NLP case study in code together.

#### When is it?
The course is being offered from the beginning of October to the beginning of November 2024, Mondays from 7 -10PM EST. Bookable office hours are available from 12-1 PM EST Wednesdays and Fridays.

### How much technical background do I need?
Some experience with Python or another programming language is suggested. Familiarity with notebook environments or code editing software is helpful but not required.

### How much does it cost? How do I pay?
At NLP from scratch, I believe that education should be accessible to everyone, regardless of their financial situation. That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm offering the course under a Pay What You Can (PWYC) model. You choose the amount you can comfortably afford, and pay based on what you feel the course was worth. There‚Äôs no minimum or maximum amount, and you can pay when you first sign up or after you‚Äôve finished attending the course ‚Äì the choice is up to you.

Your contribution, however large or small, will allow me to continue to develop and offer more courses like this in the future, making education and upskilling into NLP accessible to all.
